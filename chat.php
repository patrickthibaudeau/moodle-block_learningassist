$prompt = 'David Hackett Fisher, Champlain’s Dream (2008) [Excerpts] INTRODUCTION [p. 7-11] Champlain was a dreamer. He was a man of vision, and like most visionaries he dreamed of many things. Several scholars have written about his dream of finding a passage to China. Others have written of his dream for the colonization in New France. But all these visions were part of a larger dream that has not been studied. This war-weary soldier had a dream of humanity and peace in a world of cruelty and violence. He envisioned a new world as a place where people of different cultures could live together in amity and concord. This became his grand design for North America. Champlain was not a solitary dreamer. He moved within several circles of French humanists during the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. They are neglected figures of much importance in the history of ideas—bridge-figures who inherited the Renaissance and inspired the Enlightenment. They were not of one mind, but they had large purposes in common. One group of French humanists centered on the person of Henri IV and were guided by his great example. Another was an American circle in Paris who 1 Fischer – Champlain’s Dream  never crossed the Atlantic but were inspired by the idea of the new world. In a third group were many French humanists who came to North America with Champlain— men such as the sieur de Mons and the sieur de Razilly. In the beginning they were his leaders. By the end he became theirs. Champlain traveled in other circles among the leaders of Indian nations, who also were great dreamers. He knew them intimately, and they live as individuals in the pages of his books. Champlain had a way of getting along with very different people, and he also had the rarest gift of all. In long years of labor, he found a way to convert his dreams into realities. In the face of great obstacles and heavy defeats, he exercised his skills of leadership in extreme conditions. Those of us who are leaders today (which includes most of us in an open society) have something to learn from him about that. Champlain was a leader, but he was not a saint. We do not need another work of hagiography about him. He was a mortal man of flesh and blood, a very complicated man. He made horrific errors in his career, and some of his mistakes cost other men their lives. He cultivated an easy manner, but sometimes he drove his men so hard that four of them tried to murder him. His quest for amity and concord with the Indians led to wars with the Mohawk and the Onondaga. His private life was deeply troubled, particularly in his relations with women. Champlain lived comfortably as a man among men, but one discovery eluded this great discoverer. He 2 Fischer – Champlain’s Dream  never found the way to a woman’s heart. It was not for want of trying. He was strongly attracted to women, but his most extended relationship ended in frustration. His ideal of humanity was very large, but it was also limited in strange, ironic ways. Champlain embraced the American Indians, but not his own French servants. He had deep flaws and made many enemies, responded badly to criticism, and could be very petty to rivals. But other men who knew this man wrote of him with respect and affection. Even his enemies did so. […] A new historical ethnography has deepened our understanding of Champlain’s relations with Indians. A major school of Canadian social history led by the great scholarship of Marcel Trudel has wrought a revolution in our knowledge of Champlain’s New France. Much important work has happened in demographic and economic history. Geographers led by Conrad Heidenreich have studied his cartography in detail. Archival scholars such as Robert Le Blant have turned up much new material on Champlain and made those findings more accessible to others. The new scholarship of the early twenty-first century is becoming more mature, more global, more balanced, more empirical, more eclectic, and less ideological than before. A result of this new scholarship has been to undercut the writings of iconoclasts. Two generations ago, the dominant 3 Fischer – Champlain’s Dream  source for Champlain’s life was his own writing, which inspired skepticism. Today in every chapter of his life, we can test his own accounts against the evidence of archaeology, archival materials, other narratives, complex chronologies, and interlocking sources in great variety. Many small errors and some larger ones have been found in Champlain’s work, but the main lines of his writings have been reinforced by other evidence. An example is René Baudry, who worked with Le Blant to make much new archival material available to others. He writes of Champlain, “It is much to his credit that information from other sources almost always confirms the accuracy of his accounts.” […] It [this book] also seeks a path of understanding between hagiographers on the one hand and iconoclasts on the other. In that regard, one of the most important opportunities of this inquiry is for us to get right with both Champlain and the American Indians. Two generations ago, historians wrote of European saints and Indian savages. In the last generation, too many scholars have been writing about Indian saints and European savages. The opportunity for our generation is to go beyond that calculus of saints and savages altogether, and write about both American Indians and Europeans with maturity, empathy, and understanding. Many historians are now doing that, and this book is another effort in that direction. 4 Fischer – Champlain’s Dream  5. A SPY IN NEW SPAIN: ON His Majesty’s Secret Service, 1599-1601 [p. 94-100] […] As his travels [to New Spain under Spanish command] continued, Champlain became more sympathetic to the native people of Mexico. He described them as fully equal to Europeans in intellect, and wrote that they “are of a melancholy disposition, but nevertheless have a very quick intelligence.” He was appalled by the treatment they received from Spanish conquerors. Champlain noted a widespread pattern of tyranny, cruelty, and exploitation throughout the Spanish dominions. He reported that the silver mines of Mexico were worked by forced labor, as were the pearl fisheries, the construction of cities, the manning of galleys, and many industries. Champlain attributed this regime directly to the king of Spain, who “reserved the right of employing in them a great number of slaves, to get from the mines, for his profit, as much as they can; and he draws besides the tenth part of all that lessees get, so that these mines can produce a very good revenue to the king of Spain.” Champlain was even more horrified by the system of religious tyranny that the Spanish imposed upon the Indians. He wrote that the king of Spain, “at the commencement of his conquests, had established the 5 Fischer – Champlain’s Dream  Inquisition among them, and enslaved them or put them cruelly to death in such great numbers, that the mere account of it arouses compassion.” Champlain strongly favored the spread of Christianity in the new world, but not by cruelty and violence. He reported that the Indians were so outraged by their treatment that they made war against the Spaniards, and killed and ate them. So strong was the resistance of the Indians that “the Spaniards were constrained to take away the Inquisition, and allow them more personal liberty, granting them a milder and more tolerable rule of life.” But even in this more moderate regime, Champlain reported that Indians who did not attend mass were beaten severely by Catholic priests and given “thirty or forty blows with a stick outside the church before all the people. This is the system adopted to keep them in the faith, in which they live partly from fear of being beaten.” Champlain’s horror at this system appeared not only in his text but also in his vivid illustrations of Indians being burned by Catholic inquisitors and beaten at the church door for not attending mass. Champlain’s account of Mexico contained many errors. Some things were kept secret from him. He could not discover the location of the silver mines and was not allowed to go near them. He did not understand the source of cochineal, an enormously valuable scarlet dye that was guarded as a state secret in Spanish America. Champlain mistakenly believed that it came from a plant; perhaps he was deliberately misled by Spanish informants. He also confused cacao with the maguey, or agave. But altogether he 6 Fischer – Champlain’s Dream  was a very keen observer, and what he saw had a deep impact on his thinking. Champlain’s visit to New Spain would be fundamental to his career in New France. It turned his thoughts to another idea of empire, where Indians and Europeans could live together in a different spirit. […] He also painted images of New Spain as a system of violence and exploitation and in that way an example of how not to run an empire. TADOUSSAC: The Great Tabagie, 1603 [p. 132145] […] Pont-Gravé, Champlain, and the Montagnais were taken to a chief they called Anadabijou. They found him in a big bark lodge sixty or seventy paces long, holding a tabagie, a tobacco-feast for “eighty or one hundred companions.” Champlain described these leaders as sagamores, and Anadabijou of the Tadoussac Montagnais as the “grand sagamore” who presided over the gathering as the host. […] Champlain delighted in their singing and dancing. He wrote: “They do not stir from one spot when they dance, but make certain gestures and motions of the body, first lifting up one 7 Fischer – Champlain’s Dream  foot, and then the other, and stamping on the ground.” “Suddenly,” he continued, “all the women and girls began to take off their deerskin robes and stripped themselves stark naked, revealing their private parts, and wearing nothing but ornaments of beads and braided cords of dyed porcupine quills in many colors.” Champlain described the beauty of these girls and young women, their supple bodies undulating before him. “All these people are well proportioned in body, without any deformity,” he observed. “They are agile, and the women are well shaped, filled out and plump, of a swarthy color.” When the song was done, the Indian warriors turned toward the naked women and shouted “ho, Ho, HO!” The dancers demurely put on their robes, did their dance again, and “let fall their robes as before.” After the Algonquin women finished their dance, a sagamore of the Algonquin, who was called Bessouat or Tessoüat, rose and said: “See how we rejoice in the victory we have won over our enemies. You must do the same, and we will be content.” Once more the Indians shouted. Then Anadabijou and all the Montagnais and Etchemin rose and stripped themselves naked except for a small piece of deerskin over their genitals. Each took up something of value to them, jewelry or tomahawks, kettles, pieces of meat, and gave it to the Algonquin. After more dances and celebrations the Indians retired to their lodges. Champlain delighted in their company. He was fascinated by their character and culture, and quick to 8 Fischer – Champlain’s Dream  perceive its complexity. “All these people are of a joyous humor, and they laugh frequently,” he wrote, “and yet they are somewhat saturnine.” By “saturnine” he meant that they had an undertone of melancholy. That tension deeply interested him, and he reflected much on it. He also listened closely to their speeches, probably with the two young Montagnais translating in his ear. “They speak very deliberately,” Champlain wrote, “as though they would make themselves well understood, and stopping suddenly, reflect for a good while, and then begin to speak again.” Champlain was curious about the Indians, and happy to be among them. That attitude was reciprocated, but feelings were very complex. In the midst of much warmth, there was also a wariness on all sides. Both groups remained on their guard toward each other, and with good reason. But together they began to build a relationship that would be one of the longest and strongest on record between Europeans and Native Americans. Here was a moment of high importance in the history of North America. Nobody had planned these events, but both French and Indian leaders were quick to see an opportunity. The Great Tabagie marked the beginning of an alliance between the founders of New France and three Indian nations. Each entered willingly into the relationship and gained something of value in return. The Indians acquired a potential ally against their mortal enemies, the Iroquois. The French won support for settlement, exploration, and trade. 9 Fischer – Champlain’s Dream  The alliance that formed here would remain strong for many years because it rested on a mutuality of material interest. The leaders who had met at Pointe aux Alouettes [across from Tadoussac] also did something else. They gave a tone to the alliance. Pont-Gravé, Champlain, Anadabijou, the sagamores, and most of all the two young Montagnais who had been to Paris did that together. They treated each other with dignity, forbearance, and respect. They began to build an atmosphere of trust that was fundamental to relations between Europeans and Indians. They also kept it growing. When trust grew strong, many things were possible. When trust was lost, it was rarely regained. This meeting was important for that spirit, as well as for its substance. It marked the beginning of a relationship that was unique in the long history of European colonization in America. Something of its spirit has endured in Canada between Europeans and Indians even to our own time—an extraordinary achievement. […] The book [written by Champlain, called Des Sauvages] centered on his account of the American Indians. In that respect, its title has misled modern readers. Many people today have understood its operative word sauvages as having the same meaning as “savages” in modern French and English. In modern usage “savage” means people who are primitive, uncivilized, coarse, simple-minded, barbaric, 10 Fischer – Champlain’s Dream  brutal, violent, vicious, treacherous, ferocious, and inferior to civilized people. Champlain called the people of North America “les sauvages,” but not in that sense. In old French and early English, “sauvage” or “savage” was sometimes written salvage, a clue to its original meaning. It derived from the Latin silva, for a forest or a woodland. In the seventeenth century “sauvage” preserved this meaning, and was used to describe wild things that lived in the forest. When Champlain used the term “sauvages,” he meant forestdwellers. It is interesting that he applied this word to North American Indians but did not often use it for the people of the West Indies. He called them Indiens, people of the Indies, not “sauvages,” or people of the forest, unless they lived in woods as they did on Guadeloupe. […] When Champlain wrote about “les sauvages,” he did not mean an inferior race of people. There was nothing racist in his thinking, nothing invidious about the intellectual capacity of the people it described. The modern idea of race developed after Champlain’s era. In French and English, the full-fledged ideology of race did not emerge until the nineteenth century, with writers such as Joseph Arthur Gobineau and his contemporaries. Champlain regarded American Indians as fully equal to Europeans in intelligence and judgment, and he was much 11 Fischer – Champlain’s Dream  impressed by their qualities of mind. He wrote, “I assure you that many of them have excellent judgment, and respond very well to any question that one puts to them.” Once he wrote, “Should their spirit not grasp the usage of our arts, sciences and trades, their children who are young could do so.” Champlain was not alone in this way of thinking. Other French humanists of the period, such as the historian Marc Lescarbot, had the same high respect for the Indians, and wrote: “They have courage, fidelity, generosity, and humanity, and their hospitality is so innate and so praiseworthy that they receive among them every man who is not an enemy. They are not simpletons.” Champlain (and most of his contemporaries) also celebrated the physical condition of Native Americans. He observed that their limbs were straight, their muscles strong, their teeth were perfectly straight and white, their health seemed better, and they made a dramatic contrast with Europeans. Champlain empathized deeply with the Indians. He understood the difficult conditions of their lives, especially in the cruel Canadian winters. “All these people sometimes suffer so great extremity, on account of the great cold and snow.” Even as Champlain wrote of the Indians with sympathy and respect, he thought that some of their customs were inferior to the practices of civilized nations. He talked with the sagamore Anadabijou about their values and beliefs, and his judgments were complex. He concluded that Indians worshiped one Great Spirit, believed in the immortality of 12 Fischer – Champlain’s Dream  the soul, and had an idea of the Devil. But he regarded them as a people who had never been brought to the true faith. He tried to persuade the sagamore that the Christian faith and the Catholic religion were more true and more universal, apparently with no success. The sagamore told him “they do not make much use of religious ceremonies,” but “everyone prayed in his heart as he thought good.” Champlain wrote: “That is why I believe they have no law among them, nor know what it is to worship and pray to God, and that most of them live like brute beasts; and I think they would speedily be brought to be good Christians if their country were colonized, which they desire for the most part.” He deeply believed that the Indians were lost souls, with no hope of redemption until they were taught the true faith. But in other ways he regarded them as equal in mind and spirit to Europeans. Champlain was very curious about Indian ideas of law, and judged that in a European sense, “they are for the most part a people who have no law.” He meant that they lived by a primitive system of customary law, and an ethic of lex talionis, the rule of retaliation. He described the sadistic tortures that they inflicted on captives, and wrote: “They have one evil in them, which is that they are given to revenge, and are great liars, a people in whom it is not well to put confidence, except with reason and with force at hand. They promise much and perform little.” 13 Fischer – Champlain’s Dream  He also studied the structure of authority among the Indians, and observed that the chiefs had very little power or authority over others. Champlain noted repeatedly that chiefs would express strong opinions, but the Indians would act and judge for themselves. Most of all he thought that the Indians were too free. “Sauvage” for him also meant living in a condition of complete liberty. He had a language to describe an excess of liberty— libertinage, as in our libertine, and license. He described their sexual freedom, but noted that when an Indian girl takes many lovers and keeps company with whomever she likes, she was engaging in a form of courtship and marriage, and that by that method she selects a partner who pleases her most for her husband and they live together to the end of their lives. In these ways Champlain’s judgments of the Indians were negative, but they coexisted with many positive assessments. He took pleasure in the discovery of humanity with all its infinite variety. 9. NORUMBEGA: Three Captains, Three Results, 1604-06 [p. 198-200] […] Here were three voyages by three French leaders, with three very different results. Champlain, de Mons, and Poutrincourt had many of the same values and purposes. All shared a genuine ideal of humanity, and wanted very much to establish good relations with the natives. But when they 14 Fischer – Champlain’s Dream  actually met the Indians, they conducted themselves in different ways. Champlain’s first voyage to Norumbega in 1604 repeated the success at Tadoussac in 1603. He approached the Indians with only a few men, and made no display of weapons (though his men were armed and ready on their ship). He sat down with the Indians in another tabagie, took an interest in their ways, honored their customs, and treated them with respect. They responded in the same spirit, with warmth and trust that grew on both sides. Together they formed an alliance that lasted for many years. De Mons’ results in 1605 were mixed at best: a slow beginning, lack of focus, failed communications, and loss of rapport with the Indians. There were no tabagies or other meetings. He kept his distance and seemed unsure of the Indians. They perceived his distance as arrogance and his insecurity as enmity. The result was growing fear and hostility that compounded on itself. It ended in a needless fight. Poutrincourt’s relations with the Indians were a disaster. He could not control his men and alienated the Indian nations of Norumbega. He was fearful of them and insensitive to their feelings. Poutrincourt went among the Indians heavily armed, marched his men across their lands without warning, took crops from their fields without permission, and erected crosses that were perceived as emblems of possession. The Indians became deeply distrustful of his intentions. As 15 Fischer – Champlain’s Dream  things began to go wrong, Poutrincourt responded with a stronger show of force. He ordered his men to unsheathe their swords and fire their weapons in a demonstration of power. The Indians were terrified of him, literally trembling with fear. They sent away their women and children, and suddenly attacked. The result was a total rupture of relations. 10. PORT-Royal: A Model Colony Fails at Home, 1605-07 [p. 201-218]  These people called savages … are men like ourselves…. They have courage, fidelity, generosity, humanity, and their hospitality is so innate and praiseworthy that they receive among them every man who is not an enemy. They are not simpletons like many people over here; they speak with much judgment and good sense. —Marc Lescarbot on the Indians of Acadia IN THE SPRING OF 1605, the sieur de Mons decided to move his settlement from Sainte-Croix Island. The new site was Port-Royal, near the present town of Annapolis Royal in Nova Scotia. It was (and is) a beautiful setting, with a magnificent harbor. The soil in this part of Acadia is fertile, and the winters are more temperate than on Sainte-Croix Island. One French visitor wrote, “No earthly paradise could be more agreeable than this place.” Most important, the Indians were friendly. The Mi’kmaq (Champlain’s Souriquois) wanted close trading relations and 16 Fischer – Champlain’s Dream  an alliance against their enemies. They welcomed the French settlers, wanted them to found a colony there, and gave much vital assistance. One settler wrote, “We were not, as it were, marooned on an island, as was M. de Villegagnon in Brazil, for this nation loves the French, and would if necessary take up arms, one and all, to aid them.” […] A key to Port-Royal’s success was the relationship between the French and the Acadian Indians, who were four nations by Champlain’s reckoning, and six by ours today. Champlain and Lescarbot referred to them as Souriquois (now the Mi’kmaq), mostly on the east coast of the Bay of Fundy, the Etchemin (now Maliseet, Penobscot, and Passamaquoddy) on the west coast, Abenaquioit (now Abenaki or Wabenaki) inland to the west, and the Canadien, who lived north of Acadia and south of the St. Lawrence River. The Canadien were probably a southern branch of the people who were called Montagnais by Champlain. These nations were primarily hunters and gatherers, but they were not primitive, as too often they have been made to appear. They were highly skilled traders, and thought of themselves as superior to the farming nations to the south and west. All spoke Algonquian languages, but in different dialects. All were enemies of the hated Iroquois, but they also fought each other. They hoped that the French would be trading partners and allies in their incessant wars. Champlain tried to keep peace among them. 17 Fischer – Champlain’s Dream  The French deliberately settled very near the Indians and were comfortable in their presence. In a country of enormous size, they did not attempt to drive the Indians off the land or to push them away. To the contrary, French leaders of PortRoyal invited Mi’kmaq sagamores to share their table, and to eat and drink with them as equals on a regular basis. The Mi’kmaq in turn welcomed the French as neighbors. Each side invited the other to tabagies, as Champlain had done at Tadoussac and again on the Penobscot River. In these festivals, the French were quick to adopt Indian customs of evening feasts, with speeches and dancing, and smoking together. The Mi’kmaq sponsored some of these gatherings, and the French reciprocated. It was very different from the English in Massachusetts and Virginia, who settled apart from the Indians, kept them at a distance, annexed large tracts of land, and cultivated an attitude of distrust and contempt. The French also sent young gentlemen of the highest rank in the colony to live among the Indians, master their languages, and learn their ways.  […] CONCLUSION: A Leader’s Long Reach  [p. 525-531] Would to God that all the French who first came to this country had been like him; we should not so often have to blush for them before our savages. 18 Fischer – Champlain’s Dream  –A French missionary on Champlain1 IN THE YEAR 1832, an Indian warrior dictated a volume of his memoirs. He was Mà-Ka-Tai-Me-She-Kià-Kiàk, war chief of the Sac and Fox nations. English-speaking people knew him as Black Hawk. They held him in respect, even as they fought him in a struggle called the Black Hawk War, where Abraham Lincoln had his first experience of leadership. After the last campaign, Black Hawk asked a Métis interpreter named Antoine LeClaire to have “a history of his life written.” An enterprising Yankee journalist published it as The Autobiography of Black Hawk in 1833. Two centuries later it is still in print. The author dedicated his book to the general who had defeated him, in the hope that he “might never experience the humility that the power of the American government has reduced me to.” He explained, “This is the wish of him who in his native forests, was once as proud and bold as yourself.” The book was a warning to leaders of all nations, against the folly of false pride and blind prejudice. Black Hawk also wanted to share his memory of leaders who had avoided those errors, and he began the book with a story about two of them. One was his ancestor Na-Nà-Ma-Kee who lived “in the vicinity of Montreal” during the seventeenth century and became a war chief of his people. The other was a Frenchman who appeared in the St. Lawrence Valley at the same time. Fischer – Champlain’s Dream  19 The story began one night when Na-Nà-Ma-Kee had a dream. The Great Spirit appeared to him and said that “at the end of four years,” he would “see a white man.” Na-Nà-MaKee prepared himself for that event. For many months he blackened his face, ate only at sunset, and continued dreaming whenever he slept. Then the Great Spirit came again and told him to make a long journey. Na-Nà-Ma-Kee and his two brothers traveled five days down the St. Lawrence River, “in a direction to the left of the sun rising.” At the end of their journey they met a white man, the first they had seen. He “took Na-Nà-Ma-Kee by the hand and welcomed him into his tent.” He said that he was “the son of the King of France” and that he also had been dreaming for many years. The Great Spirit had directed him to sail across the sea to a new world, where he would meet a nation “who had never seen a white man,” and they would live together as if they were members of one family. The white man said that he had shared this dream with his father, the King of  20 Fischer – Champlain’s Dream  In the nineteenth century, Black Hawk, war chief of the Sac and Fox nations, vividly remembered Champlain through the oral traditions of his people. He began his autobiography with an account of Champlain and his own ancestor Na-Nà-Ma-Kee, as exemplars of wise and humane leadership. France, who “laughed at him and called him a Ma-she-na,” but he insisted on coming to America, where the Spirit had directed him. 21 Fischer – Champlain’s Dream  This white man was a “great and brave general,” but he came in peace. He brought trade goods but gave them to Na-NàMa-Kee as gifts. They spoke different languages, but understood each other and made a bond. Then the white man departed, promising to meet again at the same place, “after the twelfth moon.” A year later he returned, just as he had promised. He was a man who kept his word. Na-Nà-MaKee and the white war chief began a regular exchange of goods and purposes. The white man behaved honorably, and they became allies for many years. After many years the white man stopped coming. The French said he was dead. Na-Nà-Ma-Kee also died, and his people were attacked by other white men. They moved west beyond the Great Lakes to Wisconsin, then south to Iowa, and east again to a village in the Illinois country. Black Hawk said, “At this village I was born, being a regular descendant of the first chief Na-Nà-Ma-Kee.” He also became a war chief, but the more he fought with others, the more he remembered the example of Na-Nà-Ma-Kee and the great white general who regarded other nations as their kin. Black Hawk did not recall the name of this white man who lived long ago, but he was able to describe him in detail. Only one historical figure matched his description: Samuel Champlain. Black Hawk wanted his readers to remember this leader, who was unlike so many others. The memory had been preserved among the Sac and Fox nation, and carried more than a thousand miles from the St. Lawrence Valley to what is now the United States. In 1832 Black Hawk 22 Fischer – Champlain’s Dream  had it recorded on paper, in the hope that we might remember this story of Indian and European leaders who met in peace, and shared their dreams, and lived together. Many stories have been told about first encounters between American Indians and Europeans. Few of them are about harmony and peace. The more one reads of these accounts, the more one learns that something extraordinary happened in New France during the early seventeenth century— something different from what took place in New Spain, New England, and New Netherlands. Scholars of many nations agree that the founders of New France were able to maintain good relations with American Indians more effectively than any other colonizing power. This was not a simple contrast between all the French on one hand, and all the Spanish or English or Dutch on the other. Some Spaniards and Englishmen got on well with the Indians. Bartolemé de Las Casas and his Dominicans did so in New Spain, as did John Eliot and Roger Williams in New England. And other Frenchmen were very cruel. Jacques Cartier was welcomed by Indians of the St. Lawrence Valley in 1534. He repaid them by seizing their children and carrying them to France against their will. On his second voyage in 1535 Cartier kidnapped five Indians, including a chief, and their families never saw them again. But in the next century, something remarkable happened when a small group of French explorers landed among the Montagnais at Tadoussac in 1603. It happened again when they met the Penobscots at Kenduskeag in 1604, and once 23 Fischer – Champlain’s Dream  more when they settled among the Mi’kmaq of Acadia in 1605. The story was the same when these Frenchmen came among the Abenaki of Maine, the Canadien of Gaspésie, the Algonquin in the upper St. Lawrence Valley, the Huron near the Great Lakes, the Susquehannock to the south, the Winnebago in the west, and other nations. The only exceptions were their troubles with some of the Iroquois— some of the time. These Frenchmen did not try to conquer the Indians and compel them to work, as in New Spain. They did not abuse them as in Virginia, or drive them away as in New England. In the region that they began to call Canada, from 1603 to 1635, small colonies of Frenchmen and large Indian nations lived close to one another in a spirit of amitié and concorde. They formed a mutual respect for each other’s vital interests, and built a relationship of trust that endured for many years. How did that happen? The search for an answer leads to small groups of leaders in many nations, and to one French leader in particular—the only man who was at the center of events in New France through the pivotal period from 1603 to 1635. Samuel de Champlain was able to maintain close relations with many Indian nations while he founded permanent European colonies in the new world. He lived among the Indians and spent much of his time with them, while he also helped to establish three francophone populations and cultures—Québécois, Acadien, and Métis. They were very small in Champlain’s lifetime, but by the end of his life all of them had taken root and were growing in a 24 Fischer – Champlain’s Dream  sustained way. From those small beginnings, millions of people in North America trace their descent today, and they still preserve something of their origins in the way that they talk, think, and act. The most important fact about Champlain is not that he did any one of these things, but that he did all of them together. And it was done through the span of three decades, in the face of many failures and defeats. How did he do it? The first answer is that he did not act alone. Champlain always worked closely with others— Europeans and American Indians alike. He moved in a world of many circles, and worked with people who were unable to work with one another. Champlain could do that because he was genuinely interested in others and comfortable with their diversity. His origins made him so. As a child in Brouage he had lived in the presence of diversity through his early years. As a youth in Saintonge, he had grown up in a borderland between different cultures and regions. The folkways of this province had long been adapted to that environment, and they served him well through his career. Something else shaped him too. He came to maturity in a time of cruel and bitter conflict: forty years of religious strife, nine civil wars in France, and millions of deaths. As a soldier he had witnessed atrocities beyond description. After that experience, this war-weary soldier dreamed of a new world where people lived at peace with others unlike themselves. After a long and terrible war, he traveled through the Spanish empire on a mission for his king. There he had 25 Fischer – Champlain’s Dream  another shaping experience when he met American Indians and African slaves. Champlain was genuinely shocked by the abuse that had been visited upon them, and he painted images of their suffering for his king. In a world of cruelty and violence, Champlain was heir to an ethical tradition that had deep roots in the teachings of Christ. As a child he learned the Protestant paradox of God’s omnipotence and human responsibility. In later life, he became a Catholic, and believed deeply in its idea of a universal Church that was open to all humanity. He shared the large spirit of French Christian humanists who took the world for their province and regarded all God’s children as their kin. They were students of the world, with a passion for the pursuit of knowledge, as a way of understanding God’s purposes. Champlain shared this way of thinking with many others in his time. In France he belonged to several circles of French humanists. They are important and neglected figures in modern history—men who inherited the Renaissance and inspired the Enlightenment. They kept the vital impulse of humanism alive in a dark and difficult time. In that way they were world figures of high importance, and Champlain had an important place among them. In France from 1585 to 1610 these humanist circles formed around King Henri IV, and were inspired by his large ideas of peace and tolerance. Several circles centered their thoughts on North America. Champlain worked closely with 26 Fischer – Champlain’s Dream  three generations of French humanists who shared that impulse. He sought the advice of an older generation of Aymar De Chaste, Dugua de Mons, Pierre Jeannin, Cossé Brissac, and the elder Brûlart-Sillery. Closer to him in age was a middle generation of Marc Lescarbot. He also worked with a younger generation who included Isaac de Razilly, Charles de La Tour, and others. There were also several circles of Catholic humanists: Jesuits led by Paul Le Jeune and Récollets such as Theodat Sagard. In America, some of Champlain’s most interesting circles formed among Indian leaders. He worked with Membertou in Acadia, Bessabez in Norumbega, Anadabijou of the Tadoussac Montagnais, Iroquet of the Algonquin Petite nation, Ochasteguin of the Arendarhonon Huron, and many more. Dozens of Indians are mentioned by name in Champlain’s Voyages, and often described at length. He wrote of them as individuals, almost always with respect and affection. These Indian leaders, like Na-Nà-Ma-Kee’s ancestor, had their own visions and dreams. Their nations had long been at war with one another. That incessant strife had been reinforced by the coming of the Europeans. The result was a surge of violence that compounded on itself. Many Indians told Champlain that they were sick of war and wanted to find a way to end it. They were hard and practical men. But like the French leaders, they were men of vision who dreamed of a better world. 27 Fischer – Champlain’s Dream  And yet, visions and dreams were not enough. We have seen that the sieur de Mons and Poutrincourt shared Champlain’s ideal of humanity and peace. But when these three men took turns leading expeditions south along the coast of Norembega, only Champlain succeeded in establishing good relations with the Indians. De Mons and Poutrincourt tried and failed. Even as they sought peace, they lost control of events and found themselves caught in an escalating cycle of fear and suspicion that ended in violence. Champlain added another vital element to the purposes that these men shared. He was able to convert a dream into reality. By trial and error he learned how to lead men in large causes—and to do so in difficult circumstances, sometimes against desperate odds. It was typical of Champlain that he studied the problem of leadership with the same care that he brought to other questions. In 1632 he wrote a little book called Traité de la marine, et du devoir d’un bon marinier, a Treatise on Marine Affairs, and the Duty of a Good Mariner.” It is also a treatise on leadership. Most of it was about mastering skills in a rigorous way and doing small things with great care. Much of it was on the qualities that a leader must have if he wishes to succeed, and some of it remains remarkably fresh and urgent after four centuries. Champlain argued that a leader must be prévoyant, a word that has no exact equivalent in modern English. His idea of prévoyance was different from foresight in its common meaning. It is not a power to foresee the future. To the contrary, prevoyance was the ability to prepare for the 28 Fischer – Champlain’s Dream  unexpected in a world of danger and uncertainty. It was about learning to make sound judgments on the basis of imperfect knowledge. Mainly it is about taking a broad view in projects of large purpose, and about thinking for the long run. All these elements were important parts of Champlain’s leadership—so much so that this idea of prevoyance appeared even in the first sentence of his will and testament. Champlain’s idea of leadership was also an ethical idea. “Above all,” he wrote, a good leader “keeps his word in any agreement; for anyone who does not keep his word is looked upon as a coward, and forfeits his honor and reputation, however valiant a fighter he may be, and no confidence is ever placed in him.” He believed that leadership was about treating other people with humanity. He wrote that a leader “should be liberal according to his opportunities, and courteous even to his enemies, granting them all the rights to which they are entitled. Moreover, he should not practice cruelty or vengeance, like those who are accustomed to inhumane acts, and show themselves to be barbarians (barbares) rather than Christians, but if on the contrary he makes use of his success with courtesy and moderation, he will be esteemed by all, even by his enemies, who will pay him all honor and respect.” Champlain’s greatest achievement was not his career as an explorer, or his success as a founder of colonies. His largest contribution was the success of his principled leadership in the cause of humanity. That is what made him a world figure in modern history. It is his legacy to us all. 29 ';
